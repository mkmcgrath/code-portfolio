# Overview

[Note: This software is still in development- this is not a functioning application at the current moment in time]

**All Ears** is a simple terminal-based wardriving tool that scans nearby Wi-Fi networks and logs their details along with GPS coordinates. Using a GPS and Wi-Fi module, it collects metadata like SSID, signal strength, encryption type, and location as you move around. The data can be exported to CSV for easy analysis and querying.

## Key Features

- Scan for Wi-Fi networks and capture metadata
- Log GPS coordinates with each network
- Export data in CSV format

This tool is useful for network research, security auditing, or mapping network distribution in a specific area. Just remember to use it ethically and within the boundaries of the law.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used lazyvim on arch linux. The code (for now) is written in python.
Eventually, I would like to rewrite this program in C so it can run on weaker and embedded devices easier.
