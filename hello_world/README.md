# Overview

This code here is merely an attempt at establishing a template for me to follow with my other projects.

What is shown here is a simple hello world program in the C programming language.

Like mentioned above, this only exists to demonstrate a path I will follow for future, more complex programs.

# Development Environment

As seen in the video, I am using arch linux as my operating system. In the terminal, I use tmux as my terminal multiplexer. I used lazyvim to write the code, gcc to compile it, and bash to execute it.
