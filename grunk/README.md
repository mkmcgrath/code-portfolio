# Gronk

Gronk is a proof of concept text based choose your own adventure game.

I created this game because I was inspired by another game by the name of Zork III with a similar idea.

# Getting Started

Since this is a python program, there is no need for compilation. Just cone the repo and run the main program with:

```
python3 main.py
```

# Development Environment

This software was developed in the Python programming language on Arch Linux using Neovim

# Sources

A helpful introduction to those interested in the game this project was inspired by: Zork III.

# Future Development

There are several things that I have yet to implement. Like I mentioned before, this game is a proof of concept with lots of room for growth. For myself, I really just wanted to see what the process of programming a text based game would be like. Going forward, I could see myself developing this into a more robust game.

I have plans to continue developing this project in the future, but as for now, things will likely stay as they are. If you would like to contribute, please submit a pull request or fork own version!
